**************************************** CloudFormation *********************************************
 CloudFormation with ASG
     CF manage the ASG not the underlying EC2
     Define success condition for the launch of your EC2 instances using a CreationPolicy
     Define update strategies for the update of your EC2 instances using an UpdatePolicy
     In case you have to update the underlying EC2 in an ASG, you have to create a new launch conf / launch template and use an UpdatePolicy

Retaining Data on Deletes
     Use DeletionPolicy [Retain|Snapshot|Delete]

CF Custom Resources (Lambda)
     You can use custom resources in CF to do
          1- An AWS resource is not yet supported
          2- An on-prem resource
          3- Emptying a s3 bcket before deleting it
          4- Fetch AMI id
CF - Cross vs Nested Stacks
     Cross Stacks
          Helpful when stacks have different lifecycles
          Use Outputs Export and Fn::ImportValue
          Use when you need to pass export values to many stacks
     Nested Stacks
          Useful when components must be re-used

CF - Concepts
     CloudFormer: Use to create CF template for existing AWS resources
     ChangeSets: Generate and preview the CF changes before they get applied
     StackSets: Deploy a CF across mulptiple acct and regions
     Stack Policies: Prevent accidental updates/deletes to stacks resources
