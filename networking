Creating a VPC by default will create a route table, NACL, and Security Group
Only 1 IGW perv VPC
 AWS Managed VPN 
 What: is a managed IPsec VPN connection over your existing internet
 Use Case: Quick and usuallysimple way to establish a secure tunneled connection to a VPC
 Advantages: Supports static routes or BGP peering and routin
 Disadvantages: Rely on the internet connection

AWS Direct Connect
What: Dedicated network connection over private lines straight into AWS
When: Require a big pipe into AWS
Advantages: More predictable network performance, supports BGP peering and routing
Disadavantages: May require additional telecom work

AWS Direct Connect Plus VPN
What: Ipsec VPN connection over private lines
When: Want added security of encrypted tunnel over Direct Connect
Advantages: More secure than Direct Connect alone
Disadvantages: More complexity introduced bt VPN layer

AWS VPN CloudHub
What: Connect locations in a Hub and Spoke manner using AWS Virtual Private Gateway
When: Link remote offices for backp or primary WAN access to AWS resources and each other
Advantages: Reuses existing internet connection, support BGP
Disadvantages: Dependent on the internet connection

Transit VPC
What: Common way to connect geographically diisperse VPCs and locations in order to create a global network transit center
When: Locations and VPC-deployed assets across multiple regions that need to communicate with one another
Advantages: Ultimate flexibility and manageability
Disadvantages: You must design for any needed redundancy across the whole chain

VPC Peering
What: AWS prvided network connectivity between 2 VPCs
When: Multiple VPCs need to communicate or access each other resources
Advantages: Uses AWS backbone without touching the internet
Disadvantages: Transitive peering not supported, if A --> B --> C, A cannot connect to C

AWS PrivateLink
What: Provide  connection between VPCs or AWS services using interface endpoints
When: Keep private subnets truly private by using AWS backbone to reach other services rather than the internet
Advantages: Uses AWS backbone
Disadvantages: They can be accessed over inter-region VPC peering

2 Types of Endpoints: 
1- Interface Endpoint: Other services
2- Gateway Endpoint: S3 and DynamoDB

Different way to provide internet access to a VPC in AWS
1- Internet Gateway: Highly available component that allows communication between VPC and internet
     No concern about availability or bandwidth.
     Purpose1: Provide routetable target for internet bound traffic
     Purpose 2: Perform NAT for instances wit hpublic IP addr
2- Egress only IGW: Only used for IPv6. In AWS IPv6 are public by default
     For IPv6 you don't need a NAT instance to access the internet but you need an IGW or Egress-only GW  to access the internet. 
     Difference between IGW and Egress-only GW is that Egress-only GW is only outbound, it prevents inbound access to IPv6 instances
3- NAT Instance: It is an EC2 instance that translate traffic from many private IP instance to a single public IP and back. NAT instance must leave on the public subnet with route to IGW
4- NAT GW: Fully managed NAT service tat replaces need for NAT instance on EC2
     Must be created in a public subnet. 
     Good for high availability
     For multi-AZ redundancy, create NAT GE in each AZ with route for private subnets to use the local GW
     Can't use NAT GW to access VPC Peering Direct Connect

Routing
Prefix list address is used when having an endpoint to the VPC 
BGP: Border Gateway Protocol
    Popular routing protocol for the internet
    Propagates information about the network to allow for dynamic routing
    If not using BGP, you should use AWS VPC static routes

Placement Groups
1- Clustered: Putting all instances into a low latency group within the same AZ
            Use when need low network latency, good to get the most out of enhances network instances, bad because of capacity limitation.
2- Spread: Spreading instances across underlying hardware
            Use if you want to reduce risk of simultaneous failure, good because it can span multiple AZ, bad because you can only have 7 instances max running per group per AZ.
3- Partitions: Instances are grouped into partitions and spread across racks
            Use if you want to reduce risk of corrolated hardware failure for multi-instance workloads, good for large distributed or replicated workloads, bad because not recommended for Dedicated hosts
