Different type of DR
Backup and Restore: No rush to retrieve the data after a disaster.
Pilot Light: Only core component of an application will be in the DR 
Warm Stand by: Scale down of a full functional environment will be in the DR
Multi site:

Storage HA Options:
EBS Volumes: Pro: Availability target of 99.999%, easy to snapshot, supports RAID configuration
Cons: Vulnerable to AZ failure

Differents type of RAID
RAID 0: No redundancy.. Good read and write, distributing the load accross the drives
RAID 1: Copying identical data to each drive, slower on read and write
RAID 5: 1 drive can fail, Popular, Need 3 drives, 2 drive will store the data and one drive will store the parity bit
RAID 6: 2 drives can fail, minimum of 4 drives

AWS doesn't recommend RAID 5 or 6... but rather RAID 0 or 1.

HA Approaches for Databases
If possible choose DynamoDB over RDS because of inherent fault tolerance
If DynamoDB can't be used, choose Aurora because of redundancy and automatic recovery features
If Auraora can't be used, choose Multi-AZ RDS
