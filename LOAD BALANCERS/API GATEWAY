Client <-Rest AP-> Amazon API Gateway <-Proxy requests->AWS Lambda<-CRUD->DynamoDB

Limits of API Gateway
     29 seconds timeout
     10 MB max payload size
API Gateway in front of S3
     If you want to upload a large size file using API Gateway it won't be possible since the limit is 10MB. How wever you can still do the same action using different path
     1- Client send request to API gw
     2- API gw invoke a Lambda function
     3- Lambda function generate a pre-signed URL for S3
     4- The URL is forwarded to the client application
     5- The client applicaiton use the URL to upload the file to S3
