VPC Peering - No Edge to edge routing
     VPC Peering does not support edge to edge routing for NAT devices

Transit VPC (Software VPN)
     Allows for transitive connectivity between VPC & locations
Transit Gateway is prefered over Transit VPC
     Share cross-account using Resource Access Manager
     You can peer Transit gw across regions
     Support IP multicast

VPC Endpoints
     Allows you to connect to AWS Services using a private network instead of public network
     Use VPC Endpoint gw if you want your EC2 instance to talk to S3 and DynamoDB only
     Use VPC Endpoint interface if you want your EC2 to talk to any other AWS services
          With VPC Endpoint Interface, you have to setup PrivateDNS setting while creating the endpoint
          VPC Setting "Enable DNS Hostnames" and "Enable DNS Support" must be 'True"

     Private IP restriction --> aws:sourceVpc
     Public IP restriction --> aws:SourceIp

AWS PrivateLink (VPC Endpoint Services)
     Most secure & scalable way to expose a service to 1000s of VPC 
     Requires a network load balancer (Service VPC) and ENI (Customer VPC)
