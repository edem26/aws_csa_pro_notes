************************************** Cloud Migrations *********************************************
File gateway
     It is a vm to bridge between your NFS on-prem and S3
     Configured s3 are accessible using the NFS and SMB protocol
Volume gateway
     Uses iSCSI protocol backed by S3
     Cached volumes

If it takes more than one week to move files over the network, use Snowball devices
It you want to move files more than 10PB to the cloud, use Snowmobile

******************** Database Migration Services ****************************************
DynamoDB, Redshift, Kinesis are not source item for DMS

Snowball + DMS
1- Use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool to extract data locally and move it to Edge device
2- Ship the snowball edge device to AWS
3- Edge device will automatically loads the data to S3
4- AWS DMS takes the files and migrates the data to the target data store. You can use CDC to capture any change that happened while sending the data to AWS

AWS SMS is to migrate the entire VMs to AWS
