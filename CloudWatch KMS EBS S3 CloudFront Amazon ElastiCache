CloudWatch Logs - S3 Export
     S3 buckets must be encrypted with AES 256 (SSE-S3) not SSE-KMS
     Log data can take up to 12hours to become available for export
     Use API call CreateExportTask
     Not near-real time or real-time -- Use Logs Subscriptions instead

CloudWatch Logs --> subscription Filter --> Lambda Function --Real-time---> Amazon ES
CloudWatch Logs --> subscription Filter --> Kinesis Firehose -- Near real-time ---> Amazon S3
CloudWatch Logs --> subscription Filter --> Kinesis streams 

CloudWatch Logs Agents and Unified Agent cannot send logs to Kinesis -- Use the kinesis agent instead

AWS KMS
     The CMK used to encrypt data can never be retrieved by the user.
     The CMK can rotate
     KMS can only help in encrypting up to 4KB of data per call
     If data is more than 4KB, use Envelope Encryption


AWS Fargate is not cost-efficient service compared to AWS API Gateway and Lambda
WAF is not for DDoS attackes but more of HTTP layer protection

EBS Volume Types
     gp2 Cheap -- Max IOPS is 16000
     io1 Expensive -- good to use with Database
     st1 -- Godd for bid data workload
     sc1 -- Cold HDD -- Infrequently Accessed data

S3 Byte-Range Fetches
     Parallelize GETs by requesting specific byte ranges
     Better resilience in case of failures
     Used to speed up downloads

S3 Select & Glacier Select
     Retrieve less data using SQL by performing server side filtering
     Simple SQL statements

CloudFront
      CloudFront Origin
          S3 bucket
               For more security use it with Origin Access Identity
          S3 website
          Custom Origin (HTTP)
               ALB
               EC2
               API Gateway for more control otherwise use API Gateway Edge
               - CloudFront is great for static content that must be available everywhere
               - S3 Cross Region Replication is great for dynamic content that needs to be available at low  latency in few regions
     CloudFront Singned URL / Signed cookies
          Signed URL ==> Good for accessing individual files (1 signed URL/file)
          Signed cookies ==> Good for accessing multiple files (1 signed cookie for many files)
     To maximze CloudFront caching
           use less headers values
           Separate the static and the dynamic distributions
     Lambda@Edge does not have any cache
     Lambda@Edge is used for users authentication and authorization


Amazon ElastiCache
     Helps reduce load off of database for read intensive workloads
     Helps make your app stateless
     Using ElastiCache involves heavy application code changes
