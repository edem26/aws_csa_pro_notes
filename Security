Federated security models
SAML vs OAuth vs OpenID

SAML: Can handle both authorization and authentication
XML-based protocol, Can contain user, group membership, best for SSO for enterprise users

OAuth: Allow sharing of protected assets without sending login credentials, Handles authorization only not Authentication, Issues token to client, best suited for API authorization between apps

OpenID: Identity layer built on top of OAuth, adding athentication, Uses REST/JSON message flows, Supports web clients, mobile clients, Javascript clients, best suited for SSO for consumer

AWS Tools for Account Management
- AWS Organizations
- Service Conrol Policies
- Tagging
- Resource Group
- Consolidated Billing

Security Group Vs Network Access Control Lists
SG act like virtual firewalls for individual asets (EC2, RDS, etc), controls inbound and outbound traffic fr TCP, UDP, ICMP or custom protocols

NACL are additional layer of security for VPC that act as firewall, apply to entire subnets rather than individual assets, NACL are stateless meaning outbound traffic simply obey outbound rule, remember ephemeral ports for outbound if you need them


AWS Directory Services
AWS Cloud Directory: Cloud native directory to share and control access to hierarchical data between apps. It is best for cloud applications that need hierarchical data with complex relationships

AWS Cognito: Sign up and sing-in functionality that scales to millions of users and federated to public social media services. Best use to develop consumer apps or SaaS

AWS Directory Service for Microsoft AD: AWS managed full MS AD running on Windows Server 2012 R2. Best for enterprises that want hosted MS AD or need LDAP for Linux apps

AD Connector: Allow on prem users to log into AWS services with their existing AD creds. Also allows EC2 instances to join AD domain. Best for SSO for on-prem users

Simple AD: Low scale, low cost AD imlementation based on Samba. Bet for simple user directory or LDAP compatibility

Difference between 
Cloud HSM                                  and                    AWS KMS:
CloudHSM is single-tenant HSM,                         AWS KSM is multi-tenant AWS Service
Customer managed durability and available       Highly available and durable key storage mgmt
Customer managed root of trust                         AWS managed root of trust
FIPS 140-2 Level 3                                                FIPS 140-2 Level 2 / FIPS 140-2 Level 3 in some areas
Broad 3rd party support                                       Broad AWS Service support

Techniques used in AWS to mitigate DDoS
AWS Service
NACLs SGs VPC Design (Minimize attack surface)
Auto-scaling Groups, AWS CloudFront, Static Web Content via S3 (Scale to absorb attack)
Route 53, AWS WAF, AWS Shield (Safeguard exposed resources)
AWS GuardDuty CloudWatch (To learn normal behavior)

Differences between CloudWatch and CloudTrail

CloudWatch                                                                                            Cloud Trail
Log events across AWS services                                                    Log API activity across AWS services
High-level comprehensive Monitoring                                          More low-level granular
Logs stored indefinitely                                                                 Log stored to S3 or cloudwatch indef
Alarms history for 14 days                                                            No native alarms, can use cw alarms

AWS Service Catalog
It is a framework that allows admin to create pre-defined products and landscapes for their users
Make use of adopted IAM role so users don't need underlying service access
Allow users to be self-sufficient
Based on cloudformation templates

3 type of AWS Service Catalog Constraints
1- Launch constraint: IAM role that Service Catalog assumes when an user launches a product
2- Notification constraint: Use Amazon SNS topic to receive notifications when products are launched or have problems
3- Template constraint: One or more rules that narrow allowable values an end-user can select.

Identity Account Structure
     Manage all users accounts in one location
Logging Account Structure
     Centralized logging repository, can be secured so as to be immutable, can use service control policies (SCP) to prevent sub-account s from changing logging settings
Publihing Account Structure
     Common repository for AMI's, Containers, Code
Information Security Account Structure
     Hybrid of consolidated security and logging
     Allows one point of control and audit
     Logs cannot be tampered with by sub-account users
Central IT Account Structure
     IT can manage IAM users and groups while assigning to sub-account roles
     IT can provide shared services and standardized assets that adhere to corporate policy.
