Kinesis is a managed data streaming service
Good for application logs, clickstreams, IoT, real-time big data

3 main components of Kinesis
     Kinesis Streams: Low latency streaming ingest at scale
     Kinesis Analytics: Perform real-time analytics on streaming using SQL
     Kinesis Firehose: Load stream into S3, RedShift, ElasticSearch & Splunk

Kinesis Streams
     Streams are divided in ordered Shards / Partitions
          One stream is made of many different shards
          Kinesis producers:
               AWS SDK
               Kinesis Producer Library (KPL) --> Use if you are writing code for your app
               Kinesis Agent: Mnitor log file and send to kinesis directly --> Use if you need log from EC2
          Kinesis consumers
     Data retention is 24hrs by default but can go to 7 days
     Once data is inserted in Kinesis, it can't be deleted (immutability)

     Kinesis Limitations
          Producers: 
               1MB/s or 1000 msg per shard
               Add shard if you want to scale your write throughput
          Consumer Classic
               2MB/s at read per shard
               5 API calls/s per shard
          Consumer Enhanced Fan-Out
               No API calls needed

     Kinesis Data Firehose
          Near Real Time (60s minimum latency)
          Load data to Redshift/S3/ElasticSearch/Splunk
          No data storage
          Serverless, automated scaling
