Migration tools:
Storage Migration: AWS Storage Gateway AWS Snowball
Server Migration Service: Automatic migration of on-prem vmware vsphere to AWS
Replicate VMs to AWS, minimizes cutover downtime, Server migration connector is downloaded as a virtual appliance into the on-prem vSphere

Database migration service: DMS help customers migrate db to AWS RDS or EC2 based db
Schema conversion tool SCT can copy or convert db schemas. SCT is used for larger, more complex datasets like warehouses
DMS is used for smaller, simpler conversions and also supports MongoDB and DynamoDB

App discovery service: Gathers information about on-prem data centers, collects config, usage and behavior data from your servers to help in estimating TCO of running on AWS. It can run as agentless in VMware env or agent-based on non-VMware env

AWS migration hub: Regroup all these migrations tool

When migrating network, make sure that IP address do not overlap between VPC and on-prem
VPC support IPv4 netmasks range from /16 to /28
Network migration
